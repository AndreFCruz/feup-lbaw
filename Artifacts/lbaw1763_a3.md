# A3: User Interface Prototype
SegFault is a collaborative platform for programmers to learn, discuss different approaches, present ideas and share knowledge in a Q&A style.
To this end, the following sections provide detailed insight into the project, featuring storyboards for common uses of the site, and an overview of all interfaces.


## 1. Interface and common features

The user interface of the _SegFault_ platform is a set of web pages made using the latest standards: HTML5, Javascript, CSS3. For faster development Bootstrap was used.  
The platform is based on a responsive design, that is capable of being adapted to screens of different sizes and resolution without losing functionality.

The principal functionality of our platform are the questions of our users and the fast access to them. Because of that, our main page contain in their majority a preview of some questions of the users.  
A navigation bar has been implemented that allows for various interactions with the user, depending on whether the user is authenticated or not;

2. Preview of Questions;

Besides that the answer to the question is very important, so in order to be easier to the user to see that, we develop for each question an individual page.

With more emphasis, in each question page the user can see the full description of the question and also some information about the author of the question and how many votes the question have.

Following the description it will appear all the answers to the question. If one answer was marked as correct it will appear first.

Each question our answer can be commented. All last tree can be voted in order to present first the better content and give reputation to the users. This privileges is just for the authenticated users.

## 4. Interfaces

The following interfaces describe the main content of the web pages and their relative priority and help the project team previewing the features and behaviour of the final product's different screens, both their desktop (left) and mobile (right) versions.

### UI01: Home
On the [home page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/index.html), the user can view several questions to his choosing, their title, score, number of answers, and a short introduction. The user can also bookmark a question for ease of access. As customary, the user can search for a specific question using the _nav-bar_.

Additionally, an authenticated user can ask a new question: after introducing the title and clicking the "Ask!" button the user is redirected to the [question editing page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/ask_question.html). If a visitor (non-authenticated user) clicks the "Ask!" button, a "Sign-In" prompt appears.
