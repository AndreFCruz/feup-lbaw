## 4. Interfaces

The following interfaces describe the main content of the web pages and their relative priority and help the project team previewing the features and behaviour of the final product's different screens, both their desktop (left) and mobile (right) versions.

### UI01: Home
On the [home page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/index.html), the user can view several questions to his choosing, their title, score, number of answers, and a short introduction. The user can also bookmark a question for ease of access. As customary, the user can search for a specific question using the _nav-bar_.

Additionally, an authenticated user can ask a new question: after introducing the title and clicking the "Ask!" button the user is redirected to the [question editing page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/ask_question.html). If a visitor (non-authenticated user) clicks the "Ask!" button, a "Sign-In" prompt appears.

### UI02: About

The [about page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/about.html) informs the user of the the purpose of the site, as well as the team behind it. Additionally, the user can navigate to the developers' _SegFault_ profiles by clicking on them.

### UI03: Question
The question page allows a user to see the full description of a question, as well as its answers and comments. An authenticated user can vote on a question, answer or comment, or report any of these.

The owner of a question can also accept an answer as correct, edit the question's description and categories, and/or delete it.

### UI04: Ask a Question
This page allows an authenticated user to ask a question. The description can be designed with markdown, and features code syntax highlighting. The user can also add tags to a question.

Note that the title may already be filled in if the user was redirected from the main page's "Ask!" button.

### UI05: Profile

A user's [profile page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/own-profile.html) features its contributions to the _SegFault_ community, from comments, answers and questions posted, to its overall reputation and badges earned. The owner of a profile can change its profile picture and the short _bio_.

### UI07: Sign Up

### UI08: Error
The [error page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/error.html) informs the user that the server has _segfaulted_, and thus cannot visit the page he was looking for.
