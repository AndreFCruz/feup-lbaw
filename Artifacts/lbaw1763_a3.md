## 4. Interfaces

The following interfaces describe the main content of the web pages and their relative priority and help the project team previewing the features and behaviour of the final product's different screens, both their desktop (left) and mobile (right) versions.

### UI01: Home
On the [home page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/index.html), the user can view several questions to his choosing, their title, score, number of answers, and a short introduction. The user can also bookmark a question for ease of access. As customary, the user can search for a specific question using the _nav-bar_.

Additionally, an authenticated user can ask a new question: after introducing the title and clicking the "Ask!" button the user is redirected to the [question editing page](https://jflcarvalho.github.io/lbaw1763/ask_question.html). If a visitor (non-authenticated user) clicks the "Ask!" button, a "Sign-In" prompt appears.
