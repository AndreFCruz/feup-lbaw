# A11: Presentation

## 1. Product presentation

SegFault is a collaborative platform for programmers to learn, discuss different approaches, present ideas and share knowledge in a Q&A style. It's also possible to associate brief comments to questions and answers. As your questions are answered, contributors and yourself can earn reputation points and badges (symbolizing your contributions to the community).

The users can post detailed questions on the site, associating each question with a given set of categories. Additionally, users can answer questions on the site, as well as commenting other questions or answers. In order to keep the community self-moderated, users can also upvote/downvote questions/answers/comments, as well as reporting inappropriate messages. Users trusted by the community (measured by their reputation points) automatically gain the moderator status, gaining owner-like permissions over all messages (delete and edit other's messages). The website also provides advanced search options, with fuzzy matching against the question's title and content, as well as filtering search queries by categories.
