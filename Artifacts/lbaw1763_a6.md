# A6: Indices, triggers, user functions and population
SegFault is a collaborative platform for programmers to learn, discuss different approaches, present ideas and share knowledge in a Q&A style.

To this end, the following sections provide detailed insight into the inner workings of the project's database. The first section depicts the expected workload on the system, the second section specifies and explains the proposed indices to the database, and the third section comprises the database's triggers.

## 1. Database Workload
 
> A study of the predicted system load (database load), organized in subsections.
 
### 1.1. Tuple Estimation
 
> Estimate of tuples at each relation.
 
 
| Relation reference | Relation Name | Order of magnitude        | Estimated growth |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| R01                | Table1        | units|dozens|hundreds|etc | order per time   |
| R02                | Table2        | units|dozens|hundreds|etc | dozens per month |
| R03                | Table3        | units|dozens|hundreds|etc | hundreds per day |
| R04                | Table4        | units|dozens|hundreds|etc | no growth        |
 
 
### 1.2. Frequent Queries
 
> Most important queries (SELECT) and their frequency.
 
| Query reference   | SELECT01                               |
| Query description | One sentence describing the query goal |
| Query frequency   | magnitude per time                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SQL code                                                   |
 
 
### 1.3. Frequent Updates
 
> Most important updates (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and their frequency.
 
| Query reference   | UPDATE01                               |
| Query description | One sentence describing the query goal |
| Query frequency   | magnitude per time                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| SQL code                                                   |
 
 
## 2. Proposed Indices
This section presents the proposed indices on the database. It is important to note that many indices, mainly on high cardinality, would theoretically be better off being implemented as hash indices. We purposefuly did not choose these, because the PostgreSQL documentation actively discourages the usage of hash indices, as seen on the warning below.

### 2.1. Performance Indices

|                 |                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Index reference | IDX01                                               |
| Related queries | SELECT01                                            |
| Index relation  | comment                                             |
| Index attribute | commentable_id                                      |
| Index type      | B-tree                                              |
| Cardinality     | medium                                              |
| Clustering      | yes                                                 |
| Justification   | The Table is very large, and query SELECT01 must run efficiently as it is executed several times. It doesn't need range query support, and is a good candidate for clustering as its cardinality is medium. |
```sql
CREATE INDEX comment_commentable ON comment USING btree(commentable_id);
```
(This index could be implemented as a hash index, but, as explained in this section's introduction, this is actively discouraged.)

|                 |                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Index reference | IDX02                                               |
| Related queries | SELECT01, SELECT02, SELECT04, SELECT06, SELECT07    |
| Index relation  | message_version                                     |
| Index attribute | message_id                                          |
| Index type      | B-tree                                              |
| Cardinality     | medium                                              |
| Clustering      | yes                                                 |
| Justification   | The Table is very large, and the corresponding queries are abundant and recurrent, thus must run efficiently. It doesn't need range query support, and is a good candidate for clustering as its cardinality is medium. |
```sql
CREATE INDEX message_version_message ON message_version USING btree(message_id);
```




### 2.2. Full-text Search Indices 

| Index reference | IDX01                                               |
| Related queries | SELECT01, ...                                       |
| Index relation  | Relation where the index is applied                 |
| Index attribute | Attribute where the index is applied                |
| Index type      | B-tree, Hash, GiST or GIN                           |
| Clustering      | Clustering of the index                             |
| Justification   | Justification for the proposed index                |


### 2.3. Contraint-enforcing Indices



## 3. Triggers
 
> User-defined functions and trigger procedures that add control structures to the SQL language or perform complex computations, are identified and described to be trusted by the database server. Every kind of function (SQL functions, Stored procedures, Trigger procedures) can take base types, composite types, or combinations of these as arguments (parameters). In addition, every kind of function can return a base type or a composite type. Functions can also be defined to return sets of base or composite values.
 
| Trigger reference   | TRIGGER01                                                               |
| Trigger description | Trigger description, including reference to the business rules involved |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQL code                                                                                      |
 
 
## 4. Complete SQL Code
 
> The database script must also include the SQL to populate a database with test data with an amount of tuples suitable for testing and with plausible values for the fields of the database.
> This code should also be included in the group's github repository as an SQL script, and a link include here.
