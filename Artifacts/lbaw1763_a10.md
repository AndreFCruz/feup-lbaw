# A10: Product

SegFault is an online discussion forum, for professionals developers and novices alike, where users can easily share expertise on all programming related topics.

The users can post detailed questions on the site, associating each question with a given set of categories. Additionally, users can answer questions on the site, as well as commenting other questions or answers. In order to keep the community self-moderated, users can also upvote/downvote questions/answers/comments, as well as reporting inappropriate messages. Users trusted by the community (measured by their reputation points) automatically gain the moderator status, gaining owner-like permissions over all messages (delete and edit other's messages). The website also provides advanced search options, with fuzzy matching against the question's title and content, as well as filtering search queries by categories.

In this artifact, we will identify all the functionalities of our platform as well as some development details relative to the product.


## 1. Installation

Link to the Github release with the final version of the code:
[]() TODO

Full Docker command to test the group's Docker Hub image using the DBM database:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:80 -e DB_DATABASE=lbaw1763 -e DB_USERNAME=lbaw1763 -e DB_PASSWORD=sq34hv89 sudoblob/lbaw1763
```

## 2. Usage

Navigate to the following link using your favorite browser: [http://lbaw1763.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt](http://lbaw1763.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt).

### 2.1. Moderator Credentials
All users actions are available to moderators throughout the site.
For instance, a moderator may delete or edit anyone's messages, in order to ensure good content quality on the site.

|  Username  | Password |
| ---------- | -------- |
|  lbawMod   | password |

### 2.2. User Credentials

| Type          | Username  | Password |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- |
| basic account | sudoblob  | password |


## 3. Application Help

Several visual cues have been used to improve the usability of our site. For instance, as is traditional, the green color is continuously associated with positive messages/actions (used for success alerts), and the red color for negative messages/actions (used for error messages, as well as on report and delete buttons).

Additionally, several tooltips are displayed throughout the site: on the heart-shaped bookmark button, on the exclamation-shaped report button, among others. To further facilitate the use of our site, all links to users (_e.g._ on a message he posted) point to their corresponding profiles, and all links to categories (_e.g._ on the categories list of a message) point to the categories page featuring related questions.

Regarding ease of navigation, we strive for a consistent user experience across all pages, with standardized layout for the navbar and footer, as well as site-wide colors.
We also increased the site-wide contrast, to facilitate navigation on lower-quality monitors, and possibly by the colour blind.


## 4. Input Validation

> Describe how input data was validated, and provide examples to scenarios using HTML validation and server-side validation.


## 5. Check Accessibility and Usability

According to our evaluation, our site scored a 17/18 on the accessibility checklist, missing the ability to properly navigate without CSS.

Regarding usability, we scored a 26/28, missing a readability point, and "Open Graph" social network tags.


## 6. HTML & CSS Validation

We provided six PDF files in the submitted ZIP file on Moodle, two for each validated file (on NuHtmlChecker and W3CValidator). The validated files are: the global _app.css_ file, the main page (_SegFaultIndex.html_), and the question page (_SegFaultQuestion.html_).

For the _app.css_ file, the "Nu Html Checker" displayed 4 errors:
* 3 of the type "too few values for the property linear-gradient", offering no further information. According to both the MDN documentation and the W3Schools documentation the linear-gradient CSS property may receive 2, 3 or more arguments, validating our use with 3 arguments of type ```linear-gradient(direction, color-stop-1, color-stop-2)```.
* 1 of the type "is not a valid color, 3 or 6 hexadecimal expected": this is due to our use of transparency on a attribute's color (therefore using 8 hexadecimals), a feature that is available in CSS and implemented on all major browsers.

For the _app.css_ file, the "W3C Validator" displayed several errors, all bootstrap related or regarding CSS variables.

For the main page (_SegFaultIndex.html_ file), the "Nu Html Checker" displayed a single error regarding a Google related necessary script.

For the question page (_SegFaultQuestion.html_ file), the "Nu Html Checker" displayed a couple errors regarding the Markdown Editor library we're using (_simplemde_).

The "W3C Validator" for the same page files (main and question page) displayed 6 errors, all regarding imports of CSS library files (bootstrap, font-awesome, simplemde).
