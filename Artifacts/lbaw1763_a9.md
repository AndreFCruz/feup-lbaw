# A9: Main accesses to the database and transactions
This artefact shows the main accesses to the database, as well as the transactions necessary for ensuring database consistency.

For each transaction, the isolation level is explicitly stated and read-only transactions are identified to improve global performance. For each identified access, the SQL code and the reference of web resources (A7) are provided.

## 1. Main Accesses
This section describes the main accesses to the database.

| SQL101 | Search all questions by their title |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | R301 |
```sql
SELECT *
FROM questions
WHERE
  tstitle @@ plainto_tsquery('english', $search_query)
ORDER BY
  ts_rank(tstitle, plainto_tsquery('english', $search_query))
  DESC;
```
> The ```tstitle``` column is of type "tsvector", and is equal to ```to_tsvector('english', title)```, as advised in class.
This column is kept consistent with the title by updating it with triggers "on insert" and "on update".


| SQL102 | Get recent questions |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource | R301 |
```sql
SELECT questions.id, title, correct_answer,
  score, is_banned, author, content, creation_time
FROM questions, commentables, messages, message_versions
WHERE
  questions.id = commentables.id AND
  commentables.id = messages.id AND
  messages.id = message_versions.message_id AND
  messages.latest_version = message_versions.id
ORDER BY
  message_versions.creation_time DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

| SQL103 | Get a question's details |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | R306 |
```sql
SELECT *
FROM questions, messages, message_versions
WHERE
  questions.id = $question_id AND
  questions.id = messages.id AND
  messages.latest_version = message_versions.id;
```

| SQL104 | Post a questions |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | R307 |
```sql
INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
INSERT INTO commentables (id) VALUES (new_id);
INSERT INTO questions (id, title) VALUES (new_id, $title);
INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
```

| SQL105 | Post an answer |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | R314 |
```sql
INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
INSERT INTO commentables (id) VALUES (new_id);
INSERT INTO answers (id, question_id) VALUES (new_id, $question);
INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
```

| SQL106 | Post a comment on a question or answer |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | R318 and 322 |
```sql
INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
INSERT INTO comments (id, commentable_id) VALUES (new_id, $commentable);
INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
```

| SQL107 | Get a question's answers and their details |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | R312 and R313 |
```sql
SELECT *
FROM messages, answers, message_versions
WHERE
  answers.question_id = $question_id AND
  messages.id = answers.id AND
  messages.latest_version = message_versions.id
ORDER BY
  message_versions.creation_time
  DESC;
```

| SQL108 | Get a commentable's comments (question or answer). |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Web Resource  | R317 and R321 |
```sql
SELECT *
FROM commentables, messages, message_versions, comments
WHERE
  commentables.id = $commentable_id AND
  commentables.id = messages.id AND
  comments.commentable_id = commentables.id AND
  message_versions.id = messages.latest_version
ORDER BY
  message_versions.creation_time
  DESC;
```


## 2. Transactions

> Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.

| T01 | Insert a question |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Since a object-oriented approach was used to map the question UML subclass to the relational model, atomicity must be guaranteed so all classes that need to be inserted are in fact all or none inserted. |
| Isolation level | Read Uncommitted |
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

DO $$
DECLARE
  new_id INTEGER;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
  INSERT INTO commentables (id) VALUES (new_id);
  INSERT INTO questions (id, title) VALUES (new_id, $title);
  INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

| T02 | Insert an answer |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Since a object-oriented approach was used to map the answer UML subclass to the relational model, atomicity must be guaranteed so all classes that need to be inserted are in fact all or none inserted. |
| Isolation level | Read Uncommitted |
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

DO $$
DECLARE
  new_id INTEGER;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
  INSERT INTO commentables (id) VALUES (new_id);
  INSERT INTO answers (id, question_id) VALUES (new_id, $question);
  INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

| T03 | Insert a comment |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Since a object-oriented approach was used to map the comment UML subclass to the relational model, atomicity must be guaranteed so all classes that need to be inserted are in fact all or none inserted. |
| Isolation level | Read Uncommitted |
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

DO $$
DECLARE
  new_id INTEGER;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
  INSERT INTO comments (id, commentable_id) VALUES (new_id, $commentable);
  INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

Several other user stories would require the use of transactions. Fortunately, by default all statements like ```insert```, ```update``` or ```delete``` are inside their own transaction and the triggers that are fired by them also run in the same transaction. Therefore if anything fails in the execution of the trigger, then everything is rolled back, including the initial statement that fired the trigger.

We've made extensive use of this autocommit mode to ensure database integrity. For example, when a vote is made to a message, a trigger updates its score value. If these two actions weren't executed inside the same transaction and there was a failure in updating the score attribute, then the number of positive votes minus the negative ones wouldn't match the score, leaving the database in a inconsistent state.
This is true for all derived attributes, whose consistency is ensured by triggers.
