## 2. Transactions

> Transactions needed to assure the integrity of the data.

| T01 | Insert a question |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Since a object-oriented approach was used to map the question UML subclass to the relational model, atomicity must be guaranteed so all classes that need to be inserted are in fact all or none inserted. |
| Isolation level | Read Uncommitted |
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

DO $$
DECLARE
  new_id INTEGER;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
  INSERT INTO commentables (id) VALUES (new_id);
  INSERT INTO questions (id, title) VALUES (new_id, $title);
  INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

| T02 | Insert an answer |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Since a object-oriented approach was used to map the answer UML subclass to the relational model, atomicity must be guaranteed so all classes that need to be inserted are in fact all or none inserted. |
| Isolation level | Read Uncommitted |
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

DO $$
DECLARE
  new_id INTEGER;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
  INSERT INTO commentables (id) VALUES (new_id);
  INSERT INTO answers (id, question_id) VALUES (new_id, $question);
  INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

| T03 | Insert a comment |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Justification   | Since a object-oriented approach was used to map the comment UML subclass to the relational model, atomicity must be guaranteed so all classes that need to be inserted are in fact all or none inserted. |
| Isolation level | Read Uncommitted |
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

DO $$
DECLARE
  new_id INTEGER;
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO messages (author) VALUES ($author) RETURNING id INTO new_id;
  INSERT INTO comments (id, commentable_id) VALUES (new_id, $commentable);
  INSERT INTO message_versions (content, message_id) values ($content, new_id);
END $$;

COMMIT;
```

Many other user stories would require the use of transactions. Fortunately, by default all statements like ```insert```, ```update``` or ```delete``` are inside their own transaction and the triggers that are fired by them also run in the same transaction. Therefore if anything fails in the execution of the trigger, then everything is rolled back, including the initial statement that fired the trigger.

We've made extensive use of this autocommit mode to ensure database integrity. For example, when a vote is made to a message, a trigger updates its score value. If these two actions weren't executed inside the same transaction and there was a failure in updating the score attribute, then the number of positive votes minus the negative ones wouldn't match the score, leaving the database in a inconsistent state.
